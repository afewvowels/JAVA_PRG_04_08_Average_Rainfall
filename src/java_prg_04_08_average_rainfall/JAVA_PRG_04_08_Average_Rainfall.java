 * @author bluebackdev
 * Write a program that uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the
 * average rainfall over a period of years. First the program should ask for
 * the total number of years. The outer loop will iterate once for each year.
 * The inner loop will iterate 12 times, once for each month. After all
 * iterations, the program should display the number of months, the total
 * inches of rainfall, and the average rainfall per month for the entire
 * period.
 * 
 * Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of years.
 * Do not accept negative numbers for the monthly rainfall.
